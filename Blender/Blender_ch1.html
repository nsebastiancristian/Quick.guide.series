        <p>
        	Blender also has a proper Extrude function, which lets you do this with a bit more control.

Start with the default cube, as usual. Go into Edit mode. Select just the top four vertices. Press  E  to start extruding, and move the mouse roughly along the direction of the Z-axis. You will find yourself dragging out a whole new face formed from four new vertices connected to the ones you previously selected. You will notice also that the movement of the newly-added part of the mesh is automatically constrained to be parallel to the Z-axis. Press  LMB  or  ENTER  to finish the extrusion operation.
</br>
Deselect everything. Now try selecting another four vertices of the original cube, say making up a face pointing along the X-axis. Now if you extrude these, you will see that the extrusion is automatically constrained to move only parallel to the X-axis.
</br>
A quirk of the extrusion function is that if you press  E  and then immediately abort with  RMB  or  ESC , the additional mesh piece is still created, but it is left in the same position as the original mesh. To really abort the extrusion, you have to undo it with  CTRL + Z .

    	<h1>1.7. Duplicating an ojbect </h1>
     </a>
        <p>
        	 Selected  objects  are  duplicated with Shift-D.  Newly  duplicated objects  are  born  in  Grab  transformation  mode,  allowing  you  to move them away from the original object immediately.  It’s  actually  easy  to  make  a  duplicate,  then cancel the transformation, giving you two identical 
objects sitting on top of one another. You won’t be able  to  see  it  in  the  3D  view,  but  rendering  will produce  a  pattern  of  interfering  faces. </br></br> 
These duplicated objects are somewhat dependent on one another. Both the new and original objects share 
a material. Any changes you make to one’s material will affect the other as well. Animation is also duplicated,  but  the  objects  don’t  share  animation  data. </br> </br> 
This means that if you change the animation of one of  the  objects,  that  change  will  not  be  reflected  in the other object. Likewise, editing the mesh of the new object will not affect the original.
But what if you wanted all your duplicates to stay linked together? For example, you might be constructing a space battle. There are dozens of little ships zipping around, all of the same type. Halfway through 
the project, you decide that you want to add an additional engine to that type of ship. You could go in 
and add that engine to each and every copy you had made, or you could have thought ahead and used 
instancing. Instancing is the practice of making live, linked copies of a single object. </br></br> 
To instance, instead of duplicate, use Alt-D. Notice how a lot of Blender’s hotkeys use the Alt or Ctrl 
modifier to slightly change their behavior. </br></br> 
Instanced copies of an object all share the same mesh structure. Make a change to one, and it happens to 
all  instances  simultaneously.  You  can  still  assign  different  materials  and  animation  to  them,  which  you’ll understand in a moment, but the mesh is shared. </br></br>
